# object-follower

This project was inspired by YouTuber Jabrils's, drone follower.

I wrote and deployed for 4 wheeled robots.
In the video that I've attached, I used arduino to control the motors and it slowed down the control procress due to the serial communication. I modified the code to control the motors with raspberry pi which showed good results.
