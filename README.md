# object-follower

This project was inspired by YouTuber Jabrils's, drone follower.
I wrote the code to deploy in 4 wheeled robots.

In the video that I've attached, I used arduino to control the motors and it slowed down the control procress because of the serial communication. Means, the camera first captures and sends data to Raspberry Pi which then processes the information and send the motor control commands to arduino. 

I modified the code to control the motors with raspberry pi which showed good results.
